## Fatebinding

Fatebound to Jericho as a Canary/Matyr.

Invoke: Invoke this Condition after a botch: The
Scion’s player may reroll the action she’s just botched. The
Canary suffers any drawbacks or consequences of the botch
in her place — perhaps wandering into a Jotun ambush or
blurting out a faux pas.

Compel: Canaries tend to get derogatory nicknames
related to being taken hostage. The Scion gains 1 point of
Legend and the Canary gains the Imperiled Condition. The
Peril is always some form of imminent threat of death or
grievous bodily harm.

Resolve: The Canary’s sacrifice is great, but never in
vain. The Canary removes a single dramatic, life-threatening 
obstacle in the current scene: a powerful enemy, a bomb
counting down, etc., at the cost of his own life. The Scion
fulfills a Deed, and suffers a Failure Deed for an appropriate
Calling.
